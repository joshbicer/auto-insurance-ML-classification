# Auto Insurance Claims ML Classification

This script in RMarkdown is used to create 5 classification models using Machine Learning techinques. The data used is from an online Kaggle dataset and contains rows related to auto insurance claims with the target variable being a [0,1] binary output whether a driver submitted a claim or not. The inputs include demographic, car, and driver history for each customer. The goal is to identify auto insurance customers that are likely to submit claims or not based upon the results of the models.

Please see the RMarkdown file for a detailed analysis of each section of the code. The 5 binary classification models developed for this dataset are included below:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Decision Tree with Bagging
4. Random Forest with Bagging
5. Decision Tree with Boosting
